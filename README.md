# Nuxt Task App ‚úÖ

A simple task app built using Nuxt, using a SQLite db provided by Turso

## How to run üíæ

Clone or download the repo

```
https://github.com/Tyriol/nuxt-task-app.git
```

You will need to create a Turso database, which you can do here [Turso Quick Start](https://docs.turso.tech/quickstart)

Then create a `.env` file to add the following environment variables:

```
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=
```

You can of course use whatever other db you'd like.

## Why I built this ‚ùì

Continueing my journey to learn another library and framework other than React and Next, to see if I would like to invest more time down this path, but also to be better able to adapt to other languages and frameworks rather than being stuck in the React/JS mindset.

## Future features üí°

- Ability to mark a task as done.
- Ability to delete a task.
